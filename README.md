# UHDMS - Unified HR & Dev Management System

This project is a React + Vite application that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Features
- HR Management (Employees, Payroll, Analytics)
- Agile Project Management (Bugs, Tasks, Teams)
- Real-time Communication (Chat, Threads, Video Calls)
- Calendar & Scheduling

## Official Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
